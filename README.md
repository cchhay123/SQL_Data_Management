# SQL Coursework

Hi! I'm Chamroeun Chhay, currently sharpening my skills in SQL for database management and analytics. This repository showcases my SQL assignments, focusing on advanced functions, joins, data transformations, and queries using SQL.

## SELECT and ORDER BY

- **Basic Queries**: Executed complex `SELECT` statements for retrieving specific data.
- **Ordering Results**: Leveraged `ORDER BY` to organize query outputs effectively.
- **Data Filtering**: Applied `WHERE` clauses with conditions and logical operators.

*Goal*: Learn foundational querying techniques to efficiently manage and explore database contents.

## JOIN Operations and GROUP BY

- **Inner Joins**: Performed `INNER JOIN` operations to combine tables and extract meaningful insights.
- **Aggregation**: Utilized `GROUP BY` along with aggregate functions (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`) to summarize data.
- **Data Analysis**: Enhanced data analysis skills through structured and relational queries.

*Goal*: Proficiently join and aggregate data to draw actionable insights from relational databases.

## CASE, CAST, and Ranking Functions

- **CASE Statements**: Implemented conditional logic using `CASE` to classify and transform data.
- **CAST Function**: Converted data types effectively using the `CAST` function for compatibility and analysis.
- **Ranking Functions**: Applied ranking functions (`ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`) to perform detailed data analysis.

*Goal*: Gain experience in transforming and analyzing data through advanced SQL functions.

## Snowflake Schema and Data Modeling

- **Schema Design**: Designed and managed databases using the Snowflake Schema, optimized for analytical querying.
- **Normalization and Optimization**: Practiced data normalization and implemented schema optimization techniques.

*Goal*: Develop efficient database schemas to support complex analytical tasks.
